## Security

### Firestore Rules
- Users can only read their own data
- Direct balance writes are denied
- All mutations go through Cloud Functions

### Game Logic
- All game outcomes calculated server-side using secure RNG
- Daily rotating seed ensures fairness
- Wagers validated server-side
- Atomic balance updates with transaction logging

### RNG Details
- Uses SHA-256 hashing
- Combines daily seed + user UID + timestamp
- Cryptographically secure and verifiable
- Cannot be manipulated by client

## API Endpoints (Cloud Functions)

### Economy
- `economy-initUser()` - Initialize new user with 1000 FB
- `economy-getBalance()` - Get current balance

### Games
- `games-playWheel(wager)` - Spin the wheel
- `games-playCoinFlip(wager, choice)` - Flip coin (heads/tails)
- `games-playHighLow(wager, choice)` - High-low card (high/low)

### Leaderboard
- `leaderboard-getLeaderboard(limit)` - Get top players (default 50)

### History
- `history-getUserHistory(limit)` - Get user's game history (default 20)

## Troubleshooting

**"User not found" error after sign in?**
- Cloud Functions may not be deployed. Run: `firebase deploy --only functions`

**Games not working?**
- Check Cloud Functions are deployed: `firebase functions:list`
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Firestore rules are deployed

**Emulator not connecting?**
- Ensure `firebase emulators:start` is running
- Check port 5001 (functions), 8080 (firestore), 9099 (auth)

## Development Notes

- No framework dependencies (vanilla JS only)
- All styling with CSS custom properties for easy theming
- Animations use CSS keyframes (180-260ms duration)
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- All async operations use async/await

## Future Enhancements

- Persistence (save games to Cloud Storage)
- Daily bonuses and rewards
- Multiplayer tournaments
- Custom player names and avatars
- Game statistics and analytics
- Export game history as CSV

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the Firebase console for errors
2. Review Cloud Functions logs: `firebase functions:log`
3. Check browser console (DevTools > Console)
